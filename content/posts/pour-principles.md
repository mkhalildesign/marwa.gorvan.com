# POUR principles and designing with accessibility in mind

This is the blog post that accompanies my talk ‘POUR principles and designing with accessibility in mind’. I gave this talk at a LTUX London event in July 2025.

Accessibility is a tricky area to navigate, there are many grey areas that are open to interpretation and many conditions that must be catered for. The POUR framework can help simplify the process. This post is intended to help you apply this framework to your design in a thoughtful way to create human-centered intuitive products.

## Why is accessibility important?

- It is good design practice. 
- The European Accessibility Act (EAA) 2025 is a European Union law that will come into effect on June 28, 2025. This means that companies can be fined for not meeting certain criterias.
- We all need some form of accessibility at some point in our life.

The estimated population of disabled people in the UK is 25%, that is 16.9 million people. This includes those who are of pension age, working aged people, and children. It is worth noting here that children and pensioners have been included as these groups are a growing user base in technology.

## What are POUR principles?

The POUR principles are a foundational set of guidelines used to ensure web accessibility, as outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). POUR stands for:
- Perciverable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

### Perciverable

By making your designs ‘perceivable’ it ensures your content is accessible through multiple senses to make sure everyone can understand all elements of a design. Content should be available to at least one sense (sight, hearing, or touch). This can be done by:
Appropriate colour contrast 
- Use sufficient colour contrast
- Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning (e.g. red is an error).
- Allow users to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- Use clear fonts and proper line spacing.
- Alt text on images
- Captions and transcripts for videos
- Responsive design (if you can’t see it, it can’t be perceived)
- Design pages that adapt to different devices and assistive tech as well as for screen readers and zoom functionality.
