I am a product designer and UX creative working within enterprise and digital design. I specialise in UX and design within enterprise, SaaS, and B2B platforms. I work on developing products and design systems. I occasionally speak at events and enjoy writing about design.

On the side, I run [TriviaPostman](https://triviapostman.com/), an online store where you can download curated digital trivia quizzes. These fun general knowledge quizzes have been curated for quiz lovers and event hosts.
