# About
I am a product designer and UX creative working within enterprise and digital design. I specialise in UX and design within enterprise, SaaS, and B2B platforms. I work on developing products and design systems. I occasionally speak at events and enjoy writing about design.

On the side, I run TriviaPostman, an online store where you can download curated digital trivia quizzes. It is a fun project that has been curated quiz lovers and event hosts.
