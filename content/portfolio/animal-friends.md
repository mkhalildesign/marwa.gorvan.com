My goal with this project was to create an online maternity self-referral service using the Government Digital Service system.

Typically the current solution is to go to your local hospital district's website and self-refer by copying and pasting a list of questions and emailing the responses to the hospital. After that you would get a call from the midwife to go over all the information you had previously submitted as well as some additional, more personal, questions. After that, you receive your appointments with the hospital and the midwives. This process is repetitive and outdated, as well as that there are several pain points for the midwives and the expectant mothers.

## Process
![New standarised questions with break down of order](/images/port-mat-sheet.png)
1. Data organisation I got a copy of the current self-referral form from a few hospital authorities and made a list on a spreadsheet.
2. Form structure I reorganised the list into groups and broke up the form to one question per page, adding check and save points, confirmation page.
3. Rewriting the questions I rewrote the questions to be consistent and understandable. Some questions were shortened and others were expanded to provide additional context.
4. Designing form in Figma Once I had a structure I liked in my spreadsheet I started designing the pages in Figma, here I found that I was making further changes to improve the design and experience of the form.
