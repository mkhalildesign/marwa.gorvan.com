## Overview
TriviaPostman needed a way to drive traffic to its online shop and promote content from social media platforms. The objective was to create a simple and effective experience that could act as a central destination for users arriving from social channels, whilst remaining consistent with the brand’s visual identity.

### My role
I was responsible for the entire project end-to-end, including UX and UI design, content, and iteration using AI-assisted tools. This included defining the layout, refining content, aligning the design with existing branding, and ensuring the final page was responsive and ready for launch.


## Process

![Initial wireframe](/images/port-link-in-bio-01.png)

I used Lovable to generate an initial page layout as a starting point. From there, I refined the design through targeted prompting, adjusting content hierarchy, colours, and layout to better reflect TriviaPostman’s brand and goals.

One of the primary design decisions was to keep the page as a single, static experience. This allowed for:
- Faster load times
- Reduced complexity
- Easy to maintain solution that could quickly be updated
- On-brand colour choices

## Outcome
The final outcome was a [responsive website](https://triviapostman.lovable.app/) that aligned with TriviaPostman’s branding and provided a destination for social media traffic. The page now serves as a lightweight promotional hub, helping drive interest and traffic from social platforms to the shop.


## Reflection
This project allowed me to explore Lovable as a new design tool while reinforcing the importance of designer-led decisions when working with AI. While the tool provided a fast starting point, the final result was shaped by deliberate prompt refinement, content decisions, and UX judgement.
