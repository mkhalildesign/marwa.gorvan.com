This project is a fun ongoing experiment for me; it is a personal website that will show some of my work. I was inspired by the internet of the yesteryears. I wanted the visual style to be nostalgic with some added functionality. So much of my work is corporate and relies on the style and design language of others, so I wanted this to be a fun place for me.
