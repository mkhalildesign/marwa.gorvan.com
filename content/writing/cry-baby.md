People can often get enamoured by their own ideas, and it can be challenging as you might be met with defensiveness (should you not agree with them). In my experience this can cause conflict, giving critique and offering feedback is a skill that can be developed. Here are a few things that have helped me not call people’s metaphorical babies ugly.

## Focus on something positive
This can be encouraging, however if it is not genuine then it may come off as patronising and very obvious.

Baby: “Look at that cute little button nose!”

Design: “I like how you integrated the brand colours.”

## Talk about future developments
This tactic is useful to guide people in the development of the design, however be warned if the other person considers the work complete then this sort of feedback can be considered demoralising or worse passive aggressive.

Baby: “Baby is going to grow up to be so smart.”

Design: “Once the design is approved you can hand it off to the developers.”

## Focus on them
This is helpful to get a personal perspective of what is going on, it can also be helpful in establishing context around the decisions made.

Baby: “Baby looks so comfortable. How are you feeling?”

Design: “Thank you for the update. How do you think the project is going?”

## Tastefully ask about the decisions
This is useful for when you want to understand the context behind and bad decisions - Just try not try not to ask leading question.

Baby: “That’s not a name I’ve heard before, what does it mean?”

Design: “Why did you choose to use toggles on this page?”

## Change the subject
If there is nothing you can add and there isn’t a risk of failure attached to the work presented, then you can let the conversation fade naturally and change the subject.

Baby: “Aww… Did you see the new Starbucks on the corner?”

Design: “Oh, cool… Did you hear Franky from engineering was fired?”

## Tell them
This is best used as a last resort and if you don’t mind potentially burning bridges with people.

Baby: There is no metaphor here, leave the metaphorical baby alone…

Design: “I’m not sure that design solves the problem…”
