I can’t say this is the happiest list of book recommendations on the internet; but here are some of my most recent reads (and favourites) non-fiction feminist literature to make you angry at the patriarchy.

### Motherhood Penalty by Joeli Brearley

This eye-opener of a book covers the discrimination pregnant women and women with children have faced, and still do, in the work place. This book offers shocking anecdotes and stats as well as practical advice.

### Invisible Women By Caroline Criado Pérez

Invisible Women examines how women have been failed by the biased designs and systems around them. Pérez uses data to examine the impact of these decisions on women globally and challenges the perception of “male as default”.

### Men Who Hate Women by Laura Bates

Bates’ explores the underlying bias and violence against women within society as she writes about her terrifying experiences from the online world of misogyny and incels. This is both a captivating and infuriating read.

### The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf

This book is a study of how unrealistic beauty standards and societal norms are used as a means to kerb women’s autonomy. Wolf examines how popular culture shifts as the exceptions of women change - I can’t say things have changed too much since publication.
