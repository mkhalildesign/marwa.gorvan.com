It is clear to see, even if you do live in a cave, that AI is everywhere. I can’t read a job description or open my phone without being reminded of its pervasive existence. I, like many others, need to learn how to integrate this new-ish technology into my work. This is part one of trying new tools to update my design process.

I started with Lovable because I had a quick page to design and deploy. The task was straightforward; I needed a single static page with buttons that go to external links. It needed to be in keeping with the TriviaPostman brand, and as this was a page most likely found on social media platforms, it needed to be mobile-friendly.

I found the process of using Lovable to be straightforward. As I knew more or less what I wanted, there was less of a discovery phase, so I was able to use a very specific prompt. In later design iterations, I used specific links and hex codes to finalise the design. I was using the free version of Lovable, and I was able to build and deploy a complete product easily.

Overall, I was happy with [this quick project](https://marwa.gorvan.com/portfolio/link-in-bio-tp/), and I feel that Lovable can be a very helpful tool for rapid prototyping and quick deployments. Granted that my little project was very simple, but in an age where wireframes and sketches feel less and less relevant, this seems like a good compromise.
